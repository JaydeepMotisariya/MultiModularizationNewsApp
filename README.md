# MultiModularizationNewsApp
In this app, I have implemented the concept of multi-modularization to handle the news and search functionalities separately, following the MVVM Clean Architecture design pattern. I have utilized the following features to create the news app.
- Coroutine
- MVVM Architecture
- Retrofit
- Dagger Hilt
- Lottie Animation (Splash Screen)
- Glide
- Room Database
- Swipe Refresh
- CircularProgressBar
